## Stronger teams through shared responsibilities.

Non-heirarchical team structures can produce teams with more motivation and higher morale. But without a traditional manager, how can you ensure that tasks are really getting done?

[Harmonia](https://harmonia.io/?utm_source=exciting.io&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=project+copy&utm_campaign=non-heirarchical+team+structures) is our answer, intelligently assigning responsibilities for tasks as required, promoting engagement across the team whilst giving visibility of progress across the whole team.
