We've been exploring the possibilities of small, connected printers for a while now -- not only how to build them, via our [Printer](/printer) platform and dabbling with BERG's [Little Printer](http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter), but more importantly _how best to employ them_.

Is there a balance between utility and whimsy where this new medium shines? We think so, and we think we have a good example &hellip; (puts on sunglasses) &hellip; to share with you.

### New forms of fiction

Just as the then-new medium of broadcast radio gave birth to unique forms of storytelling, like live episodic dramas, there's a new form of story developing on one of the new mediums of this generation -- Twitter. The blend of anonymity, parody and the constraints of Twitter (like limited tweet length) are becoming sufficiently familar that the internet is now starting to create and experiment _on top_ of that platform, knowing, exploring and exploiting its particular strengths and weaknesses.

Accounts like [horse_ebooks](https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks)[^horse-ebooks] are a fairly extreme example of this experimentation, as are the likes of [Markov Chocolate](https://twitter.com/MarkovChocolate)[^markov] and the anthropomorphised [Tower Bridge (Itself)](https://twitter.com/twrbrdg_itself)[^tower-bridge], both by friend of _Exciting_ [Tom Armitage](http://tomarmitage.com).

But lets focus on the part of the spectrum that more closely resembles "normal" fiction -- in other words, where there's definitely an author with intent. Here's Andrew Fitzgerald giving a great overview:

He puts it better than I did:

> So once you take flexible identity, anonymity, engagement with the real world, and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story, that's when things get really interesting.

### Crimer

One of our favourite examples of this new kind of fiction is _[Crimer Show](http://twitter.com/CrimerShow)_, by [Astonishing Sod](http://twitter.com/astonishingsod). Ostensibly an absurdist take on the inexhaustible supply of police procedural dramas, but using the same alternate-universe spelling and grammar of [Freints](http://twitter.com/freints_show), _Crimer Show_ gradually builds its own world using [clichÃ©s from CSI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mznsEcZlM2I) -- (puts on sunglasses) -- and [the like](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CrimerShow?from=Main.CrimerShow):

> __CRIMER:__ Imhave do my last crimeing. Nomore crimes from Me ! __DETETCIVE:__ Thats Goodnews! __CRIMER:__ (turns to camera) Im defnitley do more crimes

It's the familiar gritty policy world wherein the _Detetcive_ (sic) has a drinking problem and the _Mayoore_ (sic) is a drug addict, but the substances abused aren't vodka and crack, but "melk" and "jeleybeens" (sic, sic) respectively.

### Catching up

While one of the unique ways Twitter fiction works is by spreading its narrative throughout the rest of your timeline, in real-time as it were, it can be hard to introduce new people to these stories once they are well under way. _Crimer Show_ is, at the time of writing, almost 1,200 tweets in, which represents a fairly arduous scrolling mission for someone who wishes to start at the start.

And it's in this problem that our [little](http://bergcloud.com) [printers](/printer) might provide a solution that strikes the balance of novel, useful and whimsical to which these devices seem most suited.

And so we present: __[The Crimer Show Printer Publication](http://remote.bergcloud.com/publications/342)__

[![A sample of the Crimer Show publication](/images/crimershow-publication-sample.jpg)](http://remote.bergcloud.com/publications/342)

You can [subscribe using BERGCloud remote here](http://remote.bergcloud.com/publications/342). Every weekday you will be treated to the next three parts of _Crimer Show_, starting from the very beginning.

We think it's the perfect way to enjoy catching up with the world of _Crimer_, alongside whatever other information you happen to be printing. You can see it sitting very comfortably in a normal daily printout:
