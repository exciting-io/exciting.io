## Tracking the pulse of conferences and events

Or: because hashtags _suck_.

Let me qualify that: hashtags are a pretty good way of following what's happening at a conference, but sometimes the most interesting tweets don't get hashtagged. Tweets like:

* where people are going for dinner
* what they *really* think about that presentation

[HeyLi.st](http://heyli.st/?utm_source=exciting.io&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=project+copy&utm_campaign=tracking+the+pulse) solves this by building a Twitter list of everyone it knows is attending the event; just follow that list to see *everything* that the attendees are tweeting, not just the wry quotes they are hashtagging.
