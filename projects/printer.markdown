## An [open source kit][printer-github] for exploring the possibilities of internet-of-things printing.

![](/images/printer/printer.jpg)

The best background is [the introductory blog post][blogpost]. In a nutshell, it's a software system that makes it easy for __YOU__ to:

* [build your own small internet-connected printers](https://github.com/freerange/printer/wiki/Making-your-own-printer)
* produce [customised content](https://github.com/freerange/printer/wiki/Building-content-services) for them, and
* [share that content](https://github.com/freerange/printer/wiki/Architecture) with other people who also have small internet-connected printers.

Read more about it in [the introductory blog post][blogpost], in [the wiki](github-wiki) or go [straight to the source][printer-github].

You can also get news and updates from [@gfrprinter][twitter] and [the mailing list][mailing-list].

[Send us a message](http://printer-mail.herokuapp.com/send/freerange) or [draw us a picture](http://printer-paint.herokuapp.com/send/freerange) and it will be printed in our office.
